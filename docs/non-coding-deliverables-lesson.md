# Using Codex for Non-Coding Deliverables

## Goal
- Leverage Codex to accelerate documentation, communication, and analytical tasks that support software delivery.

## Rationale
- Software projects rely on clear documentation, stakeholder updates, and retrospectives in addition to code.
- Codex can automate repetitive writing and analysis, freeing engineers to focus on implementation.

## Step-by-Step Instructions
1. **Identify recurring non-code outputs.** List artefacts such as release notes, ADRs, sprint summaries, onboarding guides, and incident reports produced by your team.
2. **Collect source inputs.** Gather the data Codex will need (e.g., merged PR summaries, sprint metrics, monitoring dashboards) and store them in an accessible format.
3. **Draft structured prompt templates.** Create prompts for each artefact that specify audience, tone, key sections, and any required metrics or decisions.
4. **Generate first drafts with Codex.** Provide the template and source inputs; ask Codex to produce a draft document in the correct format (Markdown, Google Doc outline, etc.).
5. **Review for accuracy and voice.** Edit the draft to ensure it reflects actual outcomes, uses appropriate terminology, and respects confidentiality.
6. **Publish to the right channels.** Store finalized documents in the team's knowledge base, ticketing system, or communication platform with clear version history.
7. **Gather feedback and iterate.** Ask stakeholders whether the Codex-assisted artefacts meet their needs and refine templates accordingly.

## Success Criteria
- Non-code deliverables are produced faster without sacrificing accuracy.
- Stakeholders acknowledge that documentation and updates meet expectations.
- Templates and prompts exist for each recurring non-code artefact.
